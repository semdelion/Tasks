     * @return Square Digits Sequence
     * * @sample Consider a sequence of numbers a0, a1, ..., an, in which an element is equal to the sum of squared digits of the previous element. The sequence ends once an element that has already been in the sequence appears again.

    Given the first element a0, find the length of the sequence.

    Example

    For a0 = 16, the output should be
    solution(a0) = 9.

    Here's how elements of the sequence are constructed:

    a0 = 16
    a1 = 12 + 62 = 37
    a2 = 32 + 72 = 58
    a3 = 52 + 82 = 89

    a7 = 22 + 02 = 4
    a8 = 42 = 16, which has already occurred before (a0)
    Thus, there are 9 elements in the sequence.

    solution(a0) = 4.

     * * @sample You work in a company that prints and publishes books. You are responsible for designing the page numbering mechanism in the printer. You know how many digits a printer can print with the leftover ink. Now you want to write a function to determine what the last page of the book is that you can number given the current page and numberOfDigits left. A page is considered numbered if it has the full number printed on it (e.g. if we are working with page 102 but have ink only for two digits then this page will not be considered numbered).

    It's guaranteed that you can number the current page, and that you can't number the last one in the book.

    Example

    For current = 1 and numberOfDigits = 5, the output should be
    solution(current, numberOfDigits) = 5.

    The following numbers will be printed: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

    For current = 21 and numberOfDigits = 5, the output should be

    The following numbers will be printed: 21, 22.

    For current = 8 and numberOfDigits = 4, the output should be
    solution(current, numberOfDigits) = 10.

    The following numbers will be printed: 8, 9, 10.*/

    Example

    For l = 10 and r = 12, the output should be
    solution(l, r) = 2.

    Here are all values of s(x) to consider:

    s(10) = 1, so 10 is comfortable with 9 and 11;
    s(11) = 2, so 11 is comfortable with 9, 10, 12 and 13;
    s(12) = 3, so 12 is comfortable with 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 15.

     * * @sample We define the weakness of number x as the number of positive integers smaller than x that have more divisors than x.

    It follows that the weaker the number, the greater overall weakness it has. For the given integer n, you need to answer two questions:

    what is the weakness of the weakest numbers in the range [1, n]?
    how many numbers in the range [1, n] have this weakness?
    Return the answer as an array of two elements, where the first element is the answer to the first question, and the second element is the answer to the second question.

    Example

    For n = 9, the output should be
    solution(n) = [2, 2].

    Here are the number of divisors and the specific weakness of each number in range [1, 9]:

    1: d(1) = 1, weakness(1) = 0;
    2: d(2) = 2, weakness(2) = 0;
    3: d(3) = 2, weakness(3) = 0;

    8: d(8) = 4, weakness(8) = 0;

    all words must be written either left-to-right or top-to-bottom;
    the area of the rectangle formed by empty cells inside the intersections isn't equal to zero.
